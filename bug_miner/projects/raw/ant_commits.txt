(Would be better if the main build script actually ensured that it was testing the classes just compiled and controlled the test CP; unless you do e.g. 'CLASSPATH=lib/optional/junit-3.8.2.jar ./bootstrap.sh test' it does not seem to work, because '/usr/bin/ant test' actually runs tests against /usr/lib/ant.jar etc. Quite a mess.)

2007-10-03 23:44:10___cafa34ca0___Various microoptimizations to reduce I/O load of common tasks, esp. no-op <javac> and <depend>. Many inner loops altered to make just 1-2 system calls rather than 4-5. You can easily see how wasteful the previous code was, and find the culprits, by patching r/o java.io.File methods and adding to -Xbootclasspath/p (or use AspectJ). E.g.:

2007-10-02 21:38:20___43953950a___Silly little optimization: <javac> was taking time quadratic in fileset size. Unfortunately this is not the only place in Ant where List.contains is called; DirectoryScanner.processIncluded seems to be as bad. Alas, someone long ago made protected Vector fields in DS, and it seems too late to change them now: even changing to ArrayList would break subclasses like FTP which call addElement!

For the same 30Mb (compressed)IP file, need about 15Mb heap at peak. Not clear whether that could be improved without breaking B/C. Another day.

2005-08-22 23:02:52___7527ef196___Antlib changes. One I like, one I am still not sure I have right 1. you can go <typedef uri="antlib:something" /> and the resource is worked out automatically from the URI. 2. if you use antlib://org/ex/resource.xml we load in the resource by its full path, so you dont need multiple packages to have multiple antlib files. I'm not sure about #2; I think it is convenient once you have antlib-only distros (i.e. inline declaration and script; nothing else), but am not sure about the syntax. Maybe antlib://org.ex/antlib.xml would be better, and more in keeping with WWW URLs; if /antlib.xml is omitted, we would add it by default.

This is just a step on the way, while I was in the method.

The key problem is that the existing code created presized arrays, but sizing these arrays meant resolving every single option and counting the #of commands -effectively creating the command line twice. Once to size it, once to save the results. this was silly and unwieldy, though it made sense given how this command grew and grew.

2002-12-27 18:14:50___f15fb7639___Update with the 2 changes: set attributes explicitely ( instead of passing the SAX2 Attributes). - import will use the normal entry point and will not depend on the sax context. We know we are in an import by looking at the importStack, that will set ignoreProjectTag flag and we'll reuse the context. There are few more changes needed to clean up the context ( some fields are no longer needed, and it needs to use proper getter/setters instead of the fields ).
2002-12-27 18:11:15___eed11060d___A change in ProjectHelper2 - RC doesn't need to depend on SAX2. The attributes are just stored in a Hashtable, you can construct the UE/RC tree without using any SAX at all.
2002-12-27 18:06:23___8d139ecb2___Add "importStack" that will allow import to keep track of loops.

2002-03-09 10:13:03___5b87919be___* Some fixes to the command-line launcher:   * Was not exiting with non-zero exit code when the build failed.   * Fix the error reporting so that the entire exception chain is reported.   * Only print out stack traces when in verbose or debug mode. * Wrap all exceptions thrown during task initialisation and execution with   a general 'task failed' exception. * Another <property> testcase.
2002-03-09 02:04:26___c8ae289dd___* Added PropertyResolver service interface, together with 2 implementations.   (One implementation mimics Ant1 behaviour). These are added in the   "workspace" packages, since that's where PropertyUtil was. Not sure if this   is the right place. * DefaultTaskContext now implements Context interface, used by   PropertyResolver. This avoids having the PropertyResolver dependent on   TaskContext, avoiding a potential circularity problem. (since TaskContext has   a "resolve" method of it's own). * Removed PropertyUtil. * Tests for PropertyResolver implementations.

This was necessary for the "numDays" functionality to work properly with my date format. - Added "default" choice to "style" attribute. If an unknown style attribute is provided, a BuildException is thrown. - Fixed examples in the documentation which not included vsspath - Only pass -R once to ss.exe and only if recursive is really specified

2001-01-20 10:43:34___dbecca155___Catch NoClassDefFoundErrors. These indicate that while a superclass is available on the classpath, a class it depends on is not. As this code is currently catching ClassNotFound exceptions anyway, this is not a major change. It will log a warning.

In recent 1.3alpha builds this role was taken by ejbdtd and the weblogicdtd attribute was now used to locate the weblogic deployment descriptor's DTD. Whilst sensible, this breaks backward comatability.

2000-12-20 11:18:13___44d572de8___Added the JAXP reference distribution jars to make it easier to build ant out of the box. Ant should now build with an empty classpath. I haven't made the changes for Unix scripts yet.

2000-12-19 15:41:25___0e42aeead___Untabifyin'

2000-12-13 09:48:33___8f2c9066b___Reverse changes and reinstate fileset + prefixedfileset
2000-12-13 09:34:10___2939f47ae___Make sure JAVA_HOME/bin/java is executable as well. Only use a single ${JAVAC} command to compile all needed classes in one pass.
2000-12-13 05:20:08___83adaf1a2___since we depend on JAVA_HOME/bin/java to exist later in the script, then we should check to make sure we can actually see the file correctly.
2000-12-13 01:59:35___d27a0a037___Udated test build file...
2000-12-13 01:33:25___8e955e3a2___Patch to unify handling of prefix filesets between war/jar/zip. It also removes a number of small errors inip task. Deprecated <prefixedfileset> element of war in favour of normal <fileset> element inip

2000-12-11 11:10:16___ac4a6335c___A small task example that illustrates something... A long time ago I argued against "if" logic as part of the defined part of Ant stating that all logic really should go into tasks. Now that the object model is clean enough, it becomes silly obvious how to do this without requiring the addition of any if/unless attributes in the target definitions themselves.
2000-12-11 10:32:08___d8a7035c5___Removed last legacy of Ant.java and have settled a bit on how front ends use core... In order for a front end to run a build, it first creates a ProjectBuilder, loads a Project from it, then can run a build on that Project. What still needs a bit of looking after is creating a project from scratch (such as a GUI might do) and then executing it. Later.
2000-12-11 09:36:22___f85678f1a___Removal.. Most of the functionality has been moved to other places now that its becoming a bit more clear how FrontEnds should interace with the core.

2000-12-07 15:35:55___9b36df2db___Missed a hardcoded indent character.

2000-06-24 02:46:17___d5bfb5609___Added MailMessage.  Hope people don't mind that I left it in com.oreilly.servlet.  I did that since it's going to be a mirror of what's in the larger com.oreilly.servlet package.  I put it under the Apache license of course, and added the ASF as an additional copyright holder.  Code can have two copyright holders, meaning either party can do as they wish with the code.  This lets the ASF upgrade to Apache License 1.2 sometime in the future, and lets me be able to use the code without thanking the ASF for code I wrote.  :-)  Updated build.xml to handle the new package.

2000-04-27 19:52:52___fd5bec819___The previous fix was not sufficient when executing Ant's build.xml as a subtask.  Apparently the base directory for Javadoc is set to the "outer" Ant's base directory, instead of the "inner" one.  This fix works around that problem by relying on the (undocumented?) fact that the "basedir" property is set automatically by Ant.

2000-02-16 14:31:45___653124c46___This is a simple patch which adds an attribute "classname" as an alias for the "class" attribute in various taskdefs. This is required for use under JDK 1.3 (RC1) due to changes in the way introspection works. Don't know about the final version of 1.3 but changing to "classname" is probably a good idea in any case. By leaving the setClass method in place, current build files can continue to be used under JDKs prior to 1.3. It also allows time for build files to be migrated. Eventually setClass should be removed.
2000-02-16 03:24:44___7f93c6c46___Accept include and exclude nested XML elements.  Also allows for the conditional inclusion/exclusion of paths based on the absence/presence of specified classes in the class path.
