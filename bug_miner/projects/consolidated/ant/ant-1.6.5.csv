I'm not sure about #2; I think it is convenient once you have antlib-only distros (i.e. inline declaration and script; nothing else), but am not sure about the syntax. Maybe antlib://org.ex/antlib.xml would be better, and more in keeping with WWW URLs; if /antlib.xml is omitted, we would add it by default."
